# VO2-take-home

# Demo
There is a video demo of the project in src/assets. It is in case that I overlooked the potential issue that may caused by screen resolution, broswers or system enviorment.


# To Run
1. clone and navigate to the folder
2. npm install(Assuming you have npm install.Please install npm if you don't)
3. npm run start
4. the project is hosted on http://localhost:3000/

# Tech
1. used CSS for styling. I use TailWind on a daily basis and I realized how I have been spoiled by TailWind.
2. used socket.io and axios for api connection
3. used formik and yup for forms and validation
4. installed prettier for formatting. `npm run format`
