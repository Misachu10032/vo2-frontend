# To Run

2. npm install

4. the project is hosted on http://localhost:3000/

# Tech
1. used CSS for styling. I use TailWind on a daily basis and I realized how I have been spoiled by TailWind.
2. used socket.io and axios for api connection
3. used formik and yup for forms and validation
4. installed prettier for formatting. `npm run format`
